# Online-music-competitions
Queniana
This online platform gives oportunities for young artists to explore their talents and get more exposed to the emerging progress of the music industries.
Many people have been hindered by economical incapabilities to hire a music studio and record their new songs.
On-line-music-competions will give the producer legal rights against piracy and the participants are prohibited from reproducing other peopleÂ´s songs for that case.
In brief, every registered member should come up with his own composed song.
